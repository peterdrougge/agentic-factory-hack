# Banbury Mixer

This page summarizes common issues, diagnostic steps, and fixes for Banbury mixing operations.

## Operating Thresholds

- Mixing temperature: normal ≤ 160°C (excessive if above 160°C)
- Mixer vibration: normal ≤ 5.5 mm/s (excessive if above 5.5 mm/s)

## Mixing Temperature Excessive (Priority: High)

- Fault Type: mixing_temperature_excessive
- Symptoms: Temperature above 160°C; compound scorching; rotor drive overload; poor compound quality
- Likely Causes: Excessive mixing speed; prolonged mixing time; inadequate cooling water; rotor tip wear; overloaded batch size
- Diagnostics:
  - Review mixing recipe parameters
  - Check cooling water flow and temperature
  - Inspect rotor tip condition
  - Verify batch weight accuracy
  - Monitor power consumption profile
- Corrective Actions:
  - Reduce rotor speed or mixing time
  - Increase cooling water flow rate
  - Replace worn rotor tips
  - Reduce batch size
  - Optimize mixing recipe
- Estimated Repair Time: 2–6 hours
- Impact: Compound properties; cure characteristics

## Excessive Mixer Vibration (Priority: High)

- Fault Type: excessive_mixer_vibration
- Symptoms: Vibration above 5.5 mm/s; unusual noise; foundation cracking; safety concerns
- Likely Causes: Rotor imbalance from uneven compound buildup; bearing wear; misaligned drive components; loose anchor bolts; gear wear
- Diagnostics:
  - Perform vibration frequency analysis
  - Inspect rotors for compound buildup
  - Check bearing condition
  - Verify drive alignment
  - Inspect foundation anchor bolts
- Corrective Actions:
  - Clean rotors thoroughly
  - Replace worn bearings
  - Realign motor and gearbox
  - Tighten foundation bolts
  - Replace worn gears
- Estimated Repair Time: 4–12 hours
- Impact: Safety; equipment damage risk; production downtime

## Notes

- Include rotor cleaning in PM; trend vibration spectrum over time.
- Confirm foundation integrity in audits to prevent progressive damage.
